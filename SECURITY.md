# Security Policy

Currently, RLT is use-at-your-own-risk; the code is not actively maintained nor updated on a regular basis, including to address security vulnerabilities.  However, reported vulnerabilities will be addressed if and when possible.

## Supported Versions

RLT releases currently (but not actively) supported with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.15.4-beta   | :white_check_mark: |
| releases prior to 0.15.4-beta   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, check to see if the issue has already been reported in [Issues](../../issues); if it has not, open a new Issue to document the vulnerability and offer known fixes or other suggestions.

At the time of this writing, since the project founder (Memetics) is new to Python and GitHub, and since this is a hobby project, such issues will be addressed if and when possible.  (I.e., there is no specific timeline when such issues will be addressed, if ever, but we'll do our best.)
