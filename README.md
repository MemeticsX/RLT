## Memetics' Random Loot Tables (RLT) for Minecraft

This project generates datapacks for (Java) Minecraft that randomize the loot tables.

Some degree of customization is supported, primarily to prevent loot table assignments that block game progress, such as assigning blaze rods to drop from an End chest when blaze rods are needed to access the End in the first place.  Customization options also allow control over frustrators: loot table assignments that would make the game too frustrating to play.  For instance, if blaze rods only dropped from infested cobblestone blocks, it might take a frustratingly long time of random digging before blaze rods could be found.

The code here is provided as-is and is not actively supported, though the developer (Memetics/viralmeme) intends to update the code from time to time.  For discussion of the project, please visit the Mining after Dark Discord: see source code for link.

End-user documentation will be provided at a later date.
