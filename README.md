Memetics' Random Loot Tables for (Java) Minecraft.

This project generates datapacks for Minecraft that randomize the loot tables.

Some degree of customization is supported, primarily to prevent loot table assignments that block game progress, such as assigning blaze rods to drop in the End, when they are needed to access the End.  But the customization also allows removal of frustrators - loot table assignments that would make the game too frustrating to play.

The code here is provided as-is and is not actively supported, though the developer (Memetics/viralmeme) will check in from time to time to update the code and review the discussion forums.

Further documentation will be provided at a later date.
